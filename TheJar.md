Now this character looks pretty funny, so this guy is Warrior Jar and you find him stuck in the ground and have the option to free him, I freed him and his decides to aid you in the Radahn festival to fight against General radahn. But really, he's honestly useless, he's not even able to touch Radahn half the fight because of how slow he is and his damage might be enough to tickle him, meanwhile Radahn is running you down with two colossal greatswords ready to snap you like a twig.
