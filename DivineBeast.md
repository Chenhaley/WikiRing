Found in the tower settlement of Belurat, messengers of the heavens, performing rituals during the festivals, the boss takes some inspiration from the Chinese dragon festivals where there is actual people under the dragons dancing around. The boss performs a series of erratic movements and uses elemental to give you a thrashing. The first time I saw this boss felt bonechilling, first appearing as a lifeless sculpture, but awakening with those green eyes a cutscene plays
