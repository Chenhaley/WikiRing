One of the most feared Commanders in Lord Mohgs Service, even after finding out his lord was slain by you, all he had to say was essentially, "My lord was felled in an honorable duel" and then he aids you in fighting a god, the god in question being Miquella and his Consort Radahn. I also find his dialogue and character designs very interesting.
