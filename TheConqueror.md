Red Lion of Caelid, Conqueror of the Stars, the mightiest of the demigods, is none other than General Radahn, Radahn is the my favorite boss not only because of the fight but also his story, a festival at Redmane Castle is hosted every now and then called, "The Radahn Festival" in respect to his name and that he may die an honorable death. Radahn after his fight with Malenia decayed and eventually lost his mind due to the Scarlet rot, losing his wits, unable to tell his former allies and enemies apart, even then he holds back the stars by the might of his will.

So the thing is, he's in his prime and you just know you are guranteed death on your first death because this Radahn is reincarnated from Lord Mohgs body which the tarnished also bests in battle. He is the final obstacle in your path to Elden Lord, very fitting as he is the mightiest. Everything about this character feels great from his theme to his combat mechanics as he is just relentless in his aggressions to give you a mean thrashing.
