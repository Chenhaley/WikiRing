One of the most enjoyable bosses that I fought, his abilities and attack animations are quite honest, a former demigod before he lost grace and became tarnished just like us. He is guided by his beast Regent Sarosh, a symbol of intelligence, as he swore to become lord, suprressing his endless lust for battle. A symbol of kingship, a symbol of lord.

After driving him back, Godfrey finds his limit approaching, he decides to rip Serosh off his back, relinquishing his lordship, to become what he was before, releasing all his rage in one last showdown to give you a beatdown. Even in defeat he praises the tarnished, "Thy strength befits a crown."
