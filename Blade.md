There are two things you know after dying over one hundred times against this boss, that she is Malenia, and she is the blade of Miquella, one of the hardest bosses that i've ever had to fight throughout my experience, not the most enjoyable fight as water foul is a move that is very annoying where she performs a series of attacks leaping around like a deathball, took me around thirty deaths to learn how to dodge it correctly
